            <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup language.</li>

            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>Headers should always be used in order from H1-6 with H1 only being used once per page.</li>
            <li>P for paragraph</li>
            <li>UTF-8 is the most commonly used "charset" with the largest universal character selection.</li>
            <li>always indicate the language used as "en" for english unless you plan to learn another language lol</li>
            <li>"!DOCTYPE html" tells the command line that HTML should follow</li>
            <li>meta data is not user facing and simply tells the browser or other developers information about the code</li>

          <li>External CSS style sheets are preferred in most cases over in line CSS or internal sheets. </li>
          <li>Add your CSS file through the command line using "touch style.css" under the appopriate directory</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a 'link' element placed in the HTML's "head", as shown in the following code:
            "head"
             "link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"
            "head"</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git revert (SHA number) - return to previous version</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. In the example involving a container named "shape" that stores a circle. var shape = "circle"</li>
          <li>You can also open Chrome DevTools using keyboard commands. If you’re using macOS, you can press Command+Option+I, and if you’re using windows, you can press Control+Shift+I.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters. </li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). </li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. To learn more about the Math object properties and methods, visit the MDN Web Docs on Math.</li>
